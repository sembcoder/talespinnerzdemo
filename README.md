<h1>TALESPINNERZ DEMO FAQ</h1>
<p><b>1. What is this?</b><br>
  TALESPINNERZ mixes up characters from fable and myth in small silly stories. Please note this version is currently one where the values are pre-populated in all the pages to demonstrate what the final product would look like.</p>
<p><b>2. How does it work?</b><br>
  Right now, due to GitHub Pages hosting limitations, the code must be downloaded from GitHub and the webpages run locally.</p>
  <p><b>3. What types of coding does this include?</b></p>
  <p><b>4. What personal accomplishments or challenges would you want to highlight?</b></p>
  <p><b>5. What are the long range plans for TALESPINNERZ?</b><br>
  This was created for a client-side only demonstration. I would really like to grow my server-side skills and be able to set up a full working version in the future.</p>
