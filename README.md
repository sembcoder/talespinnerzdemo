<h1>TALESPINNERZ DEMO FAQ</h1>
<p><b>1. What is this?</b><br>
  TALESPINNERZ mixes up characters from fable and myth in small silly stories. Please note this version is currently a client-side walkthrough mockup where the values are pre-populated in all the pages to demonstrate what the final product would look like.</p>
<p><b>2. How does it work?</b><br>
  Right now, due to GitHub Pages hosting limitations, the code must be downloaded from GitHub and the webpages run locally.</p>
  <p><b>3. What types of coding does this include?</b></p>
  <ul>
  <li> Responsive mobile design CSS.
   <li> Fields that need to be filled out in a form.
   <li> Form submit buttons, including one that only becomes functional when certain conditions are met.
   <li> JS based countdown clock.
   </ul>
  <p><b>4. What personal accomplishments or challenges would you want to highlight?</b><br>
  In terms of accomplishments, I liked the fact that I worked out with a little research how to grey out the button on the countdown page and activate it when conditions were met. This wasn't something we'd seen directly demonstrated in zyBooks or the other labs, but something I have seen often on webpages. I really enjoyed doing the research to find out how to make that work.</p>
  <p>In terms of challenges, I found out that while the flow works fine locally, the form submit buttons do not work when hosted on GitHub Pages. The code must be downloaded locally to see the flow of the demo.</p>
  <p><b>5. What are the long range plans for TALESPINNERZ?</b><br>
  This version was created for a client-side only demonstration. I would really like to grow my server-side skills and be able to set up a full working version in the future.</p>
